MysterySamples
==============

This package uses basic R/Bioconductor infrastructure and functionality to perform quality control, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and differential expression on a set of 10 samples.  It is based on publicly available one-color oligonucleotide expression data from ten samples, two each from five different normal tissues. The task is to follow the vignette and identify the five unknown tissues.
